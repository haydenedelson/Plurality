# Plurality
Runs a plurality election

## Background
*This is a problem from Problem Set 3 in Harvard's CS50 online course*

Elections come in all shapes and sizes. In the UK, the Prime Minister is officially appointed by the monarch, who generally chooses the leader of the political party that wins the most seats in the House of Commons. The United States uses a multi-step Electoral College process where citizens vote on how each state should allocate Electors who then elect the President.

Perhaps the simplest way to hold an election, though, is via a method commonly known as the “plurality vote” (also known as “first-past-the-post” or “winner take all”). In the plurality vote, every voter gets to vote for one candidate. At the end of the election, whichever candidate has the greatest number of votes is declared the winner of the election.

## Specification
Complete the implementation of plurality.c in such a way that the program simulates a plurality vote election.

- Complete the vote function.
  - `vote` takes a single argument, a `string` called `name`, representing the name of the candidate who was voted for.
  -If `name` matches one of the names of the candidates in the election, then update that candidate’s vote total to account for the new vote. The `vote` function in this case should return `true` to indicate a successful ballot.
  - If `name` does not match the name of any of the candidates in the election, no vote totals should change, and the `vote` function should return `false` to indicate an invalid ballot.
  - You may assume that no two candidates will have the same name.
- Complete the print_winner function.
  - The function should print out the name of the candidate who received the most votes in the election, and then print a newline.
  - It is possible that the election could end in a tie if multiple candidates each have the maximum number of votes. In that case, you should output the names of each of the winning candidates, each on a separate line.
